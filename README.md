Livecoding transcriptions of songs from Legend of Zelda!!

This first version is written for use with the FoxDot livecoding language (Python-accessible) and each file has the MIDI sequencing for the basic ocarina melody you play when you first learn the song, and then the full song that is played back after you succeed in learning the song!!

Please refer to https://foxdot.org/ for more information about the FoxDot livecoding language!
